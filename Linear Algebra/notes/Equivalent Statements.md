# Equivalent Statements

**(state without proof)**

If $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, then the following statements are equivalent.

1. $A$ is invertible.
2. $A\mathbf x = \mathbf0$ has only the trivial solution.
3. The reduced row echelon form of $A$ is $I_n$.
4. $A$ is expressible as a product of elementary matrices.
5. $A\mathbf x=\mathbf b$ is consistent for every $n\times1$ matrix $\mathbf b$.
6. $A\mathbf x=\mathbf b$ has exactly one solution for every $n\times1$ matrix $\mathbf b$.
7. $\det(A)\ne0$.
8. $\lambda=0$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$.
